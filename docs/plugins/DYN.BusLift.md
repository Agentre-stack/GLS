# DYN.BusLift — Phase 3 Cockpit

Goodluck cockpit for the three-band bus compressor. Multi-band thresholds feed a shared ratio/attack/release block, summed back into a blendable output with trims and soft bypass.

## Controls
- **Low/Mid/High Thresh** — band thresholds in dB before compression engages.
- **Ratio / Attack / Release** — shared detector shape for all three bands.
- **Mix** — blends compressed sum with the dry input.
- **Input / Output Trim** — pre/post gain in dB for driving or matching level.
- **Soft Bypass** — UI bypass that leaves latency/state intact.

## Factory Presets
- **Drum Bus** — tighter lows/mids with slower release, 85% blend.
- **Mix Glue** — gentler thresholds/ratio for buses, slight output makeup.
- **Vocal Lift** — deeper thresholds, faster attack for vocal smoothing.
