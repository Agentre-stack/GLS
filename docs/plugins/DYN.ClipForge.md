# DYN.ClipForge — Phase 3 Cockpit

Goodluck cockpit for the blendable clipper. Pre-HPF into soft/hard clip stages, post-tone shelving, dry/wet blend, trims, and soft bypass.

## Controls

- **Blend** — mixes soft and hard clip paths.
- **Knee** — soft clip knee in dB (0 = limiter-like).
- **Pre HPF** — high-pass before clipping to tighten lows.
- **Post Tone** — tilt shelf after clipping (positive brightens, negative warms).
- **Mix** — dry/wet blend of processed vs input.
- **Input / Output Trim** — drive or match level post-effect.
- **Soft Bypass** — UI bypass without releasing state.

## Factory Presets
- **Drum Smash** — tighter lows, brighter tone, 80% mix for energy.
- **Mix Clamp** — mid-blend hard clip with slight low-warm tilt for buses.
- **Master Edge** — gentle knee with light edge and mostly full mix for masters.
