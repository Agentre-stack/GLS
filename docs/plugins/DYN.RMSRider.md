# DYN.RMSRider — Phase 3 Cockpit

Goodluck cockpit for the RMS leveler with trims, presets, and soft bypass.

## Controls
- **Target / Speed / Range** — target RMS level, response speed, and max boost/cut window.
- **HF Sensitivity** — weight highs to influence detection.
- **Lookahead** — pre-delay for smoother gain moves.
- **Input / Output Trim** — pre/post gain staging.
- **Soft Bypass** — UI bypass without releasing state.

## Factory Presets
- **Vocal Smooth** — medium speed, gentle range, slight HF tilt, light makeup.
- **Mix Leveler** — slower, wider range for general bus leveling.
- **Broadcast Tight** — faster response, tighter window, small input trim.
