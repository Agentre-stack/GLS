# Dual Tap — MDL.DualTap

**Category:** Mod/Delay/LFO  
**Role:** Dual modulated delay taps with feedback, filters, and independent pan.

## Signal Flow

`Input -> Tap A Delay + HP/LP -> Tap B Delay + HP/LP -> Mix/Pan -> Output`

## Parameters
- `delay_a`: Tap A time (ms).
- `delay_b`: Tap B time.
- `feedback`: Global feedback amount.
- `mix`: Wet/dry blend.
- `pan_a` / `pan_b`: Stereo placement for each tap.
- `tone_hpf`/`tone_lpf`: Filter each tap.

## Notes
- Use different pans to widen guitars; use filters per tap to keep clarity.
- Feedback interacts with filters for tape-smear style echoes.
